## Introduction
This project explores the implementation of smart surveillance in the context of smart cities, focusing on real-time object detection and tracking. It addresses challenges such as:
- Processing video streams from distributed data sources
- Reducing network load and latency
- Enhancing data security and privacy

## Human Object Detection
We implement two main algorithms for human object detection:
1. HOG+SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients + Support Vector Machine)
2. KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters)

## Object Tracking
Our system uses a multi-tracker object queue to manage multiple objects across video frames. Key features include:
- Initialization of new trackers for detected objects
- Continuous tracking using KCF algorithm
- Handling of objects entering and leaving the frame

## Lightweight Human Tracking
We combine HOG+SVM for detection and KCF for tracking to achieve efficient and lightweight human detection and tracking, suitable for edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of edge-based video processing for smart surveillance, offering:
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Improved security and privacy
- Efficient operation in resource-constrained environments
